<h1>Mark Twain</h1>
<div id="toc"></div>
<p>
  Samuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835 – April 21, 1910),[1] better known by his pen name Mark Twain, was an
  American author and humorist. He wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry
  Finn (1885),[2] the latter often called "the Great American Novel."
</p>

<p>
  Twain grew up in Hannibal, Missouri, which provided the setting for Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer. After an
  apprenticeship with a printer, he worked as a typesetter and contributed articles to the newspaper of his older
  brother Orion Clemens. He later became a riverboat pilot on the Mississippi River before heading west to join Orion in
  Nevada. He referred humorously to his singular lack of success at mining, turning to journalism for the Virginia City
  Territorial Enterprise.[3] In 1865, his humorous story, "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," was
  published, based on a story he heard at Angels Hotel in Angels Camp, California, where he had spent some time as a
  miner. The short story brought international attention, and was even translated into classic Greek.[4] His wit and
  satire, in prose and in speech, earned praise from critics and peers, and he was a friend to presidents, artists,
  industrialists, and European royalty.
</p>

<p>
  Though Twain earned a great deal of money from his writings and lectures, he invested in ventures that lost a great
  deal of money, notably the Paige Compositor, which failed because of its complexity and imprecision. In the wake of
  these financial setbacks, he filed for protection from his creditors via bankruptcy, and with the help of Henry
  Huttleston Rogers eventually overcame his financial troubles. Twain chose to pay all his pre-bankruptcy creditors in
  full, though he had no legal responsibility to do so.
</p>

<p>
  Twain was born shortly after a visit by Halley's Comet, and he predicted that he would "go out with it," too. He died
  the day following the comet's subsequent return. He was lauded as the "greatest American humorist of his age,"[5] and
  William Faulkner called Twain "the father of American literature."[6]
</p>

<h2>Early life</h2>

<p>
  Samuel Langhorne Clemens was born in Florida, Missouri, on November 30, 1835. He was the son of Jane (née Lampton;
  1803–1890), a native of Kentucky, and John Marshall Clemens (1798–1847), a Virginian by birth. His parents met when
  his father moved to Missouri and were married several years later, in 1823.[7][8] He was the sixth of seven children,
  but only three of his siblings survived childhood: his brother Orion (1825–1897); Henry, who died in a riverboat
  explosion (1838–1858); and Pamela (1827–1904). His sister Margaret (1833–1839) died when he was three, and his brother
  Benjamin (1832–1842) died three years later. Another brother, Pleasant (1828–1829), died at six months.[9] Twain was
  born two weeks after the closest approach to Earth of Halley's Comet.
</p>

<p>
  When he was four, Twain's family moved to Hannibal, Missouri,[10] a port town on the Mississippi River that inspired
  the fictional town of St. Petersburg in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.[11] Missouri
  was a slave state and young Twain became familiar with the institution of slavery, a theme he would later explore in
  his writing. Twain's father was an attorney and judge.[12] The Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad was organized in his
  office in 1846. The railroad connected the second and third largest cities in the state and was the westernmost United
  States railroad until the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad. It delivered mail to and from the Pony
  Express.[13]
</p>

<p>
  In 1847, when Twain was 11, his father died of pneumonia.[14] The next year, he became a printer's apprentice. In
  1851, he began working as a typesetter and contributor of articles and humorous sketches for the Hannibal Journal, a
  newspaper owned by his brother Orion. When he was 18, he left Hannibal and worked as a printer in New York City,
  Philadelphia, St. Louis, and Cincinnati. He joined the newly formed International Typographical Union, the printers
  union, and educated himself in public libraries in the evenings, finding wider information than at a conventional
  school.[15] Clemens came from St. Louis on the packet Keokuk in 1854[16] and lived in Muscatine during part of the
  summer of 1855. The Muscatine newspaper published eight stories, which amounted to almost 6,000 words.[17]
</p>

<p>
  Twain describes in Life on the Mississippi how when he was a boy "there was but one permanent ambition" among his
  comrades: to be a steamboatman. "Pilot was the grandest position of all. The pilot, even in those days of trivial
  wages, had a princely salary - from a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty dollars a month, and no board to
  pay." As Twain describes it, the pilot's prestige exceeded that of the captain. The pilot had to "get up a warm
  personal acquaintanceship with every old snag and one-limbed cottonwood and every obscure wood pile that ornaments the
  banks of this river for twelve hundred miles; and more than that, must ... actually know where these things are in the
  dark..." Steamboat pilot Horace E. Bixby took on Twain as a "cub" pilot to teach him the river between New Orleans and
  St. Louis for $500, payable out of Twain's first wages after graduating. Twain studied the Mississippi, learning its
  landmarks, how to navigate its currents effectively, and how to "read the river" and its constantly shifting channels,
  reefs, submerged snags and rocks that would "tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated."[18] It was
  more than two years before he received his steamboat pilot license in 1859. This occupation gave him his pen name,
  Mark Twain, from "mark twain," the leadsman's cry for a measured river depth of two fathoms, which was safe water for
  a steamboat. While training, Samuel convinced his younger brother Henry to work with him. Henry was killed on June 21,
  1858, when the steamboat he was working on, the Pennsylvania, exploded. Twain had foreseen this death in a dream a
  month earlier,[19]:275 which inspired his interest in parapsychology; he was an early member of the Society for
  Psychical Research.[20] Twain was guilt-stricken and held himself responsible for the rest of his life. He continued
  to work on the river and was a river pilot until the American Civil War broke out in 1861 and traffic along the
  Mississippi was curtailed.
</p>

<p>
  At the start of the Civil War, Twain enlisted briefly in a Confederate local unit. He then left for Nevada to work for
  his brother, Orion Clemens, who was secretary of the Nevada Territory, which Twain describes in his book Roughing
  It.[21][22] Twain later wrote a sketch, "The Private History of a Campaign That Failed," which told how he and his
  friends had been Confederate volunteers for two weeks before disbanding their company.[23]
</p>

<h2>Travels</h2>

<p>
  Twain joined Orion, who in 1861 became secretary to James W. Nye, the governor of Nevada Territory, and headed west.
  Twain and his brother traveled more than two weeks on a stagecoach across the Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains,
  visiting the Mormon community in Salt Lake City.
</p>

<p>
  Twain's journey ended in the silver-mining town of Virginia City, Nevada, where he became a miner on the Comstock
  Lode.[23] Twain failed as a miner and worked at a Virginia City newspaper, the Territorial Enterprise.[24] Working
  under writer and friend Dan DeQuille, here he first used his pen name. On February 3, 1863, he signed a humorous
  travel account "Letter From Carson – re: Joe Goodman; party at Gov. Johnson's; music" with "Mark Twain."[25]
</p>

<p>
  His experiences in the American West inspired Roughing It and his experiences in Angels Camp, California, in Calaveras
  County, provided material for "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County".
</p>

<p>
  Twain moved to San Francisco, California, in 1864, still as a journalist. He met writers such as Bret Harte and
  Artemus Ward. The young poet Ina Coolbrith may have romanced him.[26]
</p>

<p>
  His first success as a writer came when his humorous tall tale, "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," was
  published in a New York weekly, The Saturday Press, on November 18, 1865. It brought him national attention. A year
  later, he traveled to the Sandwich Islands (present-day Hawaii) as a reporter for the Sacramento Union. His
  travelogues were popular and became the basis for his first lectures.[27]
</p>

<p>
  In 1867, a local newspaper funded a trip to the Mediterranean. During his tour of Europe and the Middle East, he wrote
  a popular collection of travel letters, which were later compiled as The Innocents Abroad in 1869. It was on this trip
  that he met his future brother-in-law, Charles Langdon. Both were passengers aboard the Quaker City on their way to
  the Holy Land. Langdon showed a picture of his sister Olivia to Twain; Twain claimed to have fallen in love at first
  sight.
</p>

<p>
  Upon returning to the United States, Twain was offered honorary membership in the secret society Scroll and Key of
  Yale University in 1868.[28] Its devotion to "fellowship, moral and literary self-improvement, and charity" suited him
  well.
</p>

<h2>Marriage and children</h2>

<p>
  Throughout 1868, Twain and Olivia Langdon corresponded, but she rejected his first marriage proposal. Two months
  later, they were engaged. In February 1870, Twain and Langdon were married in Elmira, New York,[27] where he had
  courted her and had overcome her father's initial reluctance.[29] She came from a "wealthy but liberal family," and
  through her, he met abolitionists, "socialists, principled atheists and activists for women's rights and social
  equality," including Harriet Beecher Stowe (his next-door neighbor in Hartford, Connecticut), Frederick Douglass, and
  the writer and utopian socialist William Dean Howells,[30] who became a long-time friend. The couple lived in Buffalo,
  New York, from 1869 to 1871. Twain owned a stake in the Buffalo Express newspaper and worked as an editor and writer.
  While they were living in Buffalo, their son Langdon died of diphtheria at age 19 months. They had three daughters:
  Susy (1872–1896), Clara (1874–1962)[31] and Jean (1880–1909). The couple's marriage lasted 34 years, until Olivia's
  death in 1904. All of the Clemens family are buried in Elmira's Woodlawn Cemetery.
</p>

<p>
  Twain moved his family to Hartford, Connecticut, where starting in 1873 he arranged the building of a home (local
  admirers saved it from demolition in 1927 and eventually turned it into a museum focused on him). In the 1870s and
  1880s, Twain and his family summered at Quarry Farm, the home of Olivia's sister, Susan Crane.[32][33] In 1874,[32]
  Susan had a study built apart from the main house so that her brother-in-law would have a quiet place in which to
  write. Also, Twain smoked pipes constantly, and Susan Crane did not wish him to do so in her house. During his
  seventeen years in Hartford (1874–1891) and over twenty summers at Quarry Farm, Twain wrote many of his classic
  novels, among them The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), The Prince and the Pauper (1881), Life on the Mississippi
  (1883), Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885) and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889).
</p>

<p>
  Twain made a second tour of Europe, described in the 1880 book A Tramp Abroad. His tour included a stay in Heidelberg
  from May 6 until July 23, 1878, and a visit to London.
</p>

<h2>Love of science and technology</h2>

<p>
  Twain was fascinated with science and scientific inquiry. He developed a close and lasting friendship with Nikola
  Tesla, and the two spent much time together in Tesla's laboratory.
</p>

<p>
  Twain patented three inventions, including an "Improvement in Adjustable and Detachable Straps for Garments" (to
  replace suspenders) and a history trivia game.[34] Most commercially successful was a self-pasting scrapbook; a dried
  adhesive on the pages needed only to be moistened before use.
</p>

<p>
  His book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court features a time traveler from the contemporary US, using his
  knowledge of science to introduce modern technology to Arthurian England. This type of storyline would later become a
  common feature of a science fiction sub-genre, alternate history.
</p>

<p>
  In 1909, Thomas Edison visited Twain at his home in Redding, Connecticut, and filmed him. Part of the footage was used
  in The Prince and the Pauper (1909), a two-reel short film. It is said to have been the only known existing film
  footage of Twain.[35]
</p>

<h2>Financial troubles</h2>

<p>
  Twain made a substantial amount of money through his writing, but he lost a great deal through investments, mostly in
  new inventions and technology, particularly the Paige typesetting machine. It was a beautifully engineered mechanical
  marvel that amazed viewers when it worked, but it was prone to breakdowns. Twain spent $300,000 (equal to $8,200,000
  in inflation-adjusted terms [36]) on it between 1880 and 1894;[37] but, before it could be perfected, it was made
  obsolete by the Linotype. He lost not only the bulk of his book profits but also a substantial portion of his wife's
  inheritance.[38]
</p>

<p>
  Twain also lost money through his publishing house, Charles L. Webster and Company, which enjoyed initial success
  selling the memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant but went broke soon after, losing money on a biography of Pope Leo XIII; fewer
  than two hundred copies were sold.[38]
</p>

<p>
  Twain's writings and lectures, combined with the help of a new friend, enabled him to recover financially.[39] In
  1893, he began a 15-year-long friendship with financier Henry Huttleston Rogers, a principal of Standard Oil. Rogers
  first made Twain file for bankruptcy. Then Rogers had Twain transfer the copyrights on his written works to his wife,
  Olivia, to prevent creditors from gaining possession of them. Finally, Rogers took absolute charge of Twain's money
  until all the creditors were paid.
</p>

<p>
  Twain accepted an offer from Robert Sparrow Smythe[40] and embarked on a year-long, around-the-world lecture tour in
  July 1895[41] to pay off his creditors in full, although he was no longer under any legal obligation to do so.[42] It
  would be a long, arduous journey and he was sick much of the time, mostly from a cold and a carbuncle. The itinerary
  took him to Hawaii, Fiji, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, India, Mauritius, South Africa and England. Twain's three
  months in India became the centerpiece of his 712-page book Following the Equator. He joined the Anti-Imperialist
  League in 1898, in opposition to the U.S. annexation of the Philippines.[citation needed]
</p>

<p>
  In mid-1900, he was the guest of newspaper proprietor Hugh Gilzean-Reid at Dollis Hill House, located on the north
  side of London, UK. In regard to Dollis Hill, Twain wrote that he had "never seen any place that was so satisfactorily
  situated, with its noble trees and stretch of country, and everything that went to make life delightful, and all
  within a biscuit's throw of the metropolis of the world."[43] He then returned to America in 1900, having earned
  enough to pay off his debts.
</p>

<h2>Speaking engagements</h2>

<p>
  Twain was in demand as a featured speaker, performing solo humorous talks similar to what would become stand-up
  comedy.[44] He gave paid talks to many men's clubs, including the Authors' Club, Beefsteak Club, Vagabonds, White
  Friars, and Monday Evening Club of Hartford. In the late 1890s, he spoke to the Savage Club in London and was elected
  honorary member. When told that only three men had been so honored, including the Prince of Wales, he replied "Well,
  it must make the Prince feel mighty fine."[45] In 1897, Twain spoke to the Concordia Press Club in Vienna as a special
  guest, following diplomat Charlemagne Tower, Jr.. In German, to the great amusement of the assemblage, Twain delivered
  the speech "Die Schrecken der deutschen Sprache" ("The Horrors of the German Language").[46] In 1901, Twain was
  invited to speak at Princeton University's Cliosophic Literary Society, where he was made an honorary member.[47]
</p>

<h2>Later life and death</h2>

<p>
  Twain passed through a period of deep depression that began in 1896 when his daughter Susy died of meningitis.
  Olivia's death in 1904 and Jean's on December 24, 1909, deepened his gloom.[49] On May 20, 1909, his close friend
  Henry Rogers died suddenly. In 1906, Twain began his autobiography in the North American Review. In April, Twain heard
  that his friend Ina Coolbrith had lost nearly all she owned in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and he volunteered a
  few autographed portrait photographs to be sold for her benefit. To further aid Coolbrith, George Wharton James
  visited Twain in New York and arranged for a new portrait session. Initially resistant, Twain admitted that four of
  the resulting images were the finest ones ever taken of him.[50]
</p>

<p>
  Twain formed a club in 1906 for girls he viewed as surrogate granddaughters, the Angel Fish and Aquarium Club. The
  dozen or so members ranged in age from 10 to 16. Twain exchanged letters with his "Angel Fish" girls and invited them
  to concerts and the theatre and to play games. Twain wrote in 1908 that the club was his "life's chief delight".[51]
  In 1907 Twain met Dorothy Quick (then aged 11) on a transatlantic crossing, beginning "a friendship that was to last
  until the very day of his death".[52]
</p>
<blockquote>
  "I came in with Halley's Comet in 1835. It is coming again next year, and I expect to go out with it. It will be the
  greatest disappointment of my life if I don't go out with Halley's Comet. The Almighty has said, no doubt: 'Now here
  are these two unaccountable freaks; they came in together, they must go out together.' "
</blockquote>
<p>
  His prediction was accurate—Twain died of a heart attack on April 21, 1910, in Redding, Connecticut, one day after the
  comet's closest approach to Earth.
</p>

<p>
  Upon hearing of Twain's death, President William Howard Taft said:[54][55]
</p>
<blockquote>
  "Mark Twain gave pleasure – real intellectual enjoyment – to millions, and his works will continue to give such
  pleasure to millions yet to come ... His humor was American, but he was nearly as much appreciated by Englishmen and
  people of other countries as by his own countrymen. He has made an enduring part of American literature."
  Twain's funeral was at the "Old Brick" Presbyterian Church in New York.[56] He is buried in his wife's family plot at
  Woodlawn Cemetery in Elmira, New York. The Langdon family plot where he is buried is marked by a 12-foot (two fathoms,
  or "mark twain") monument, placed there by his surviving daughter, Clara.[57] There is also a smaller headstone.
  Although he expressed a preference for cremation (for example in Life on the Mississippi), he acknowledged that his
  surviving family would have the last word.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Officials in Connecticut and New York estimated the value of Twain's estate at $471,000 ($12,000,000 today); his
  manuscripts were given no monetary value, and his copyrights given little and decreasing value.[58]
</p>

<h2>Writing</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>
  Twain began his career writing light, humorous verse, but evolved into a chronicler of the vanities, hypocrisies and
  murderous acts of mankind. At mid-career, with Huckleberry Finn, he combined rich humor, sturdy narrative and social
  criticism. Twain was a master at rendering colloquial speech and helped to create and popularize a distinctive
  American literature built on American themes and language. Many of Twain's works have been suppressed at times for
  various reasons. Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has been repeatedly restricted in American high schools, not least for
  its frequent use of the word "nigger," which was in common usage in the pre-Civil War period in which the novel was
  set.
</p>

<p>
  A complete bibliography of his works is nearly impossible to compile because of the vast number of pieces written by
  Twain (often in obscure newspapers) and his use of several different pen names. Additionally, a large portion of his
  speeches and lectures have been lost or were not written down; thus, the collection of Twain's works is an ongoing
  process. Researchers rediscovered published material by Twain as recently as 1995.[38]
</p>

<h3>Early journalism and travelogues</h3>

<p>
  While writing for the Virginia City newspaper, the Territorial Enterprise in 1863, Clemens met lawyer Tom Fitch,
  editor of the competing newspaper Virginia Daily Union and known as the "silver-tongued orator of the Pacific."[59]:51
  He credited Fitch with giving him his "first really profitable lesson" in writing. In 1866, Clemens presented his
  lecture on the Sandwich Islands to a crowd in Washoe City, Nevada.[60] Clemens commented that, "When I first began to
  lecture, and in my earlier writings, my sole idea was to make comic capital out of everything I saw and heard." Fitch
  told him, "Clemens, your lecture was magnificent. It was eloquent, moving, sincere. Never in my entire life have I
  listened to such a magnificent piece of descriptive narration. But you committed one unpardonable sin—the unpardonable
  sin. It is a sin you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your
  audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest, with a piece of atrocious anti-climax which nullified all the really
  fine effect you had produced."[61] It was in these days that Twain became a writer of the Sagebrush School, and was
  known later as the most notable within this literary genre.[62]
</p>

<p>
  Twain's first important work, "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County," was first published in the New York
  Saturday Press on November 18, 1865. The only reason it was published there was that his story arrived too late to be
  included in a book Artemus Ward was compiling featuring sketches of the wild American West.
</p>

<p>
  After this burst of popularity, the Sacramento Union commissioned Twain to write letters about his travel experiences.
  The first journey he took for this job was to ride the steamer Ajax in its maiden voyage to Hawaii, referred to at the
  time as the Sandwich Islands. These humorous letters proved the genesis to his work with the San Francisco Alta
  California newspaper, which designated him a traveling correspondent for a trip from San Francisco to New York City
  via the Panama isthmus. All the while, Twain was writing letters meant for publishing back and forth, chronicling his
  experiences with his burlesque humor. On June 8, 1867, Twain set sail on the pleasure cruiser Quaker City for five
  months. This trip resulted in The Innocents Abroad or The New Pilgrims' Progress.
</p>

<p>
  This book is a record of a pleasure trip. If it were a record of a solemn scientific expedition it would have about it
  the gravity, that profundity, and that impressive incomprehensibility which are so proper to works of that kind, and
  withal so attractive. Yet not withstanding it is only a record of a picnic, it has a purpose, which is, to suggest to
  the reader how he would be likely to see Europe and the East if he looked at them with his own eyes instead of the
  eyes of those who traveled in those countries before him. I make small pretense of showing anyone how he ought to look
  at objects of interest beyond the sea—other books do that, and therefore, even if I were competent to do it, there is
  no need.
</p>

<p>
  In 1872, Twain published a second piece of travel literature, Roughing It, as a semi-sequel to Innocents. Roughing It
  is a semi-autobiographical account of Twain's journey from Missouri to Nevada, his subsequent life in the American
  West, and his visit to Hawaii. The book lampoons American and Western society in the same way that Innocents critiqued
  the various countries of Europe and the Middle East. Twain's next work kept Roughing It's focus on American society
  but focused more on the events of the day. Entitled The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today, it was not a travel piece, as his
  previous two books had been, and it was his first attempt at writing a novel. The book is also notable because it is
  Twain's only collaboration; it was written with his neighbor Charles Dudley Warner.
</p>

<p>
  Twain's next two works drew on his experiences on the Mississippi River. Old Times on the Mississippi, a series of
  sketches published in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875, featured Twain's disillusionment with Romanticism.[63] Old Times
  eventually became the starting point for Life on the Mississippi.
</p>

<h3>Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn</h3>

<p>
  Twain's next major publication was The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which drew on his youth in Hannibal. Tom Sawyer was
  modeled on Twain as a child, with traces of two schoolmates, John Briggs and Will Bowen. The book also introduced in a
  supporting role Huckleberry Finn, based on Twain's boyhood friend Tom Blankenship.
</p>

<p>
  The Prince and the Pauper, despite a storyline that is omnipresent in film and literature today, was not as well
  received. Telling the story of two boys born on the same day who are physically identical, the book acts as a social
  commentary as the prince and pauper switch places. Pauper was Twain's first attempt at historical fiction, and blame
  for its shortcomings is usually put on Twain for having not been experienced enough in English society, and also on
  the fact that it was produced after a massive hit. In between the writing of Pauper, Twain had started Adventures of
  Huckleberry Finn (which he consistently had problems completing[64]) and started and completed another travel book, A
  Tramp Abroad, which follows Twain as he traveled through central and southern Europe.
</p>

<p>
  Twain's next major published work, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, solidified him as a noteworthy American writer.
  Some have called it the first Great American Novel, and the book has become required reading in many schools
  throughout the United States. Huckleberry Finn was an offshoot from Tom Sawyer and had a more serious tone than its
  predecessor. The main premise behind Huckleberry Finn is the young boy's belief in the right thing to do though most
  believed that it was wrong. Four hundred manuscript pages of Huckleberry Finn were written in mid-1876, right after
  the publication of Tom Sawyer. Some accounts have Twain taking seven years off after his first burst of creativity,
  eventually finishing the book in 1883. Other accounts have Twain working on Huckleberry Finn in tandem with The Prince
  and the Pauper and other works in 1880 and other years. The last fifth of Huckleberry Finn is subject to much
  controversy. Some say that Twain experienced, as critic Leo Marx puts it, a "failure of nerve." Ernest Hemingway once
  said of Huckleberry Finn:
</p>
<blockquote>
  If you read it, you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen from the boys. That is the real end. The rest is just
  cheating.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Hemingway also wrote in the same essay:
</p>
<blockquote>
  All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn.[65]
</blockquote>
<p>
  Near the completion of Huckleberry Finn, Twain wrote Life on the Mississippi, which is said to have heavily influenced
  the former book.[38] The work recounts Twain's memories and new experiences after a 22-year absence from the
  Mississippi. In it, he also states that "Mark Twain" was the call made when the boat was in safe water – two fathoms
  (12 feet or 3.7 metres).
</p>

<h3>Later writing</h3>

<p>
  After his great work, Twain began turning to his business endeavors to keep them afloat and to stave off the
  increasing difficulties he had been having from his writing projects. Twain focused on President Ulysses S. Grant's
  Memoirs for his fledgling publishing company, finding time in between to write "The Private History of a Campaign That
  Failed" for The Century Magazine. This piece detailed his two-week stint in a Confederate militia during the Civil
  War. The name of his publishing company was Charles L. Webster & Company, which he owned with Charles L. Webster, his
  nephew by marriage.[66]
</p>

<h3>Twain in his later years</h3>

<p>
  Twain next focused on A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which featured him making his first big
  pronouncement of disappointment with politics. Written with the same historical fiction style of The Prince and the
  Pauper, A Connecticut Yankee showed the absurdities of political and social norms by setting them in the court of King
  Arthur. The book was started in December 1885, then shelved a few months later until the summer of 1887, and
  eventually finished in the spring of 1889.
</p>

<p>
  To pay the bills and keep his business projects afloat, Twain had begun to write articles and commentary furiously,
  with diminishing returns, but it was not enough. He filed for bankruptcy in 1894.
</p>

<p>
  His next large-scale work, Pudd'nhead Wilson, was written rapidly, as Twain was desperately trying to stave off the
  bankruptcy. From November 12 to December 14, 1893, Twain wrote 60,000 words for the novel.[38] Critics have pointed to
  this rushed completion as the cause of the novel's rough organization and constant disruption of continuous plot.
  There were parallels between this work and Twain's financial failings, notably his desire to escape his current
  constraints and become a different person.
</p>

<p>
  Like The Prince and the Pauper, this novel also contains the tale of two boys born on the same day who switch
  positions in life. Considering the circumstances of Twain's birth and Halley's Comet, and his strong belief in the
  paranormal, it is not surprising that these "mystic" connections recur throughout his writing.
</p>

<p>
  The actual title is not clearly established. It was first published serially in Century Magazine, and when it was
  finally published in book form, Pudd'nhead Wilson appeared as the main title; however, the disputed "subtitles" make
  the entire title read: The Tragedy of Pudd'nhead Wilson and the Comedy of The Extraordinary Twins.[38]
</p>

<p>
  Twain's next venture was a work of straight fiction that he called Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc and dedicated
  to his wife. Twain had long said that this was the work he was most proud of, despite the criticism he received for
  it. The book had been a dream of his since childhood. He claimed he had found a manuscript detailing the life of Joan
  of Arc when he was an adolescent.[38] This was another piece Twain was convinced would save his publishing company.
  His financial adviser, Henry Huttleston Rogers, quashed that idea and got Twain out of that business altogether, but
  the book was published nonetheless.
</p>

<p>
  During this time of dire financial straits, Twain published several literary reviews in newspapers to help make ends
  meet. He famously derided James Fenimore Cooper in his article detailing Cooper's "Literary Offenses." He became an
  extremely outspoken critic of not only other authors, but also other critics, suggesting that before praising Cooper's
  work, Thomas Lounsbury, Brander Matthews, and Wilkie Collins "ought to have read some of it."[67]
</p>

<p>
  Other authors to fall under Twain's attack during this time period (beginning around 1890 until his death) were George
  Eliot, Jane Austen, and Robert Louis Stevenson.[68] In addition to providing a source for the "tooth and claw" style
  of literary criticism, Twain outlines in several letters and essays what he considers to be "quality writing." He
  places emphasis on concision, utility of word choice, and realism (he complains that Cooper's Deerslayer purports to
  be realistic but has several shortcomings). Ironically, several of his works were later criticized for lack of
  continuity (Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) and organization (Pudd'nhead Wilson).
</p>

<p>
  Twain's wife died in 1904 while the couple were staying at the Villa di Quarto in Florence; and, after an appropriate
  period of time, Twain allowed himself to publish some works that his wife, a de facto editor and censor throughout his
  life, had looked down upon. Of these works, The Mysterious Stranger, depicting various visits of Satan to the Earth,
  is perhaps the best known. This particular work was not published in Twain's lifetime. There were three versions found
  in his manuscripts, made between 1897 and 1905: the Hannibal, Eseldorf, and Print Shop versions. Confusion among the
  versions led to an extensive publication of a jumbled version, and only recently have the original versions as Twain
  wrote them become available.
</p>

<p>
  Twain's last work was his autobiography, which he dictated and thought would be most entertaining if he went off on
  whims and tangents in non-chronological order. Some archivists and compilers have rearranged the biography into more
  conventional forms, thereby eliminating some of Twain's humor and the flow of the book. The first volume of
  autobiography, over 736 pages, was published by the University of California in November 2010, 100 years after his
  death, as Twain wished.[69][70] It soon became an unexpected[71] best seller,[72] making Twain one of very few authors
  publishing new best-selling volumes in all three of the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.
</p>

<h2>Censorship</h2>

<p>
  Twain’s works have been subjected to censorship efforts. According to Stuart (2013) “Leading these banning campaigns,
  generally, were religious organizations or individuals in positions of influence – not so much working librarians, who
  had been instilled with that American “library spirit” which honored intellectual freedom (within bounds of course).
  In 1905, the Brooklyn Public Library banned both The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer
  from the children's department because of their language.[73]
</p>

<h2>Views</h2>

<p>
  Twain's views became more radical as he grew older. He acknowledged that his views changed and developed over his
  life, referring to one of his favorite works:
</p>
<blockquote>
  When I finished Carlyle's French Revolution in 1871, I was a Girondin; every time I have read it since, I have read it
  differently—being influenced and changed, little by little, by life and environment ... and now I lay the book down
  once more, and recognize that I am a Sansculotte! And not a pale, characterless Sansculotte, but a Marat.[74]
</blockquote>
<h3>Anti-imperialist</h3>

<p>
  In the New York Herald, October 15, 1900, he describes his transformation and political awakening, in the context of
  the Philippine-American War, from being "a red-hot imperialist":
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    I wanted the American eagle to go screaming into the Pacific ... Why not spread its wings over the Philippines, I
    asked myself? ... I said to myself, Here are a people who have suffered for three centuries. We can make them as
    free as ourselves, give them a government and country of their own, put a miniature of the American Constitution
    afloat in the Pacific, start a brand new republic to take its place among the free nations of the world. It seemed
    to me a great task to which we had addressed ourselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    But I have thought some more, since then, and I have read carefully the treaty of Paris [which ended the
    Spanish-American War], and I have seen that we do not intend to free, but to subjugate the people of the
    Philippines. We have gone there to conquer, not to redeem.
  </p>

  <p>
    It should, it seems to me, be our pleasure and duty to make those people free, and let them deal with their own
    domestic questions in their own way. And so I am an anti-imperialist. I am opposed to having the eagle put its
    talons on any other land.[75]
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Before 1899, Twain was an ardent imperialist. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, he spoke out strongly in favor of
  American interests in the Hawaiian Islands.[76] In the mid-1890s he explained later, he was "a red-hot imperialist. I
  wanted the American eagle to go screaming over the Pacific."[77] He said the war with Spain in 1898 was "the
  worthiest" war ever fought.[78] In 1899, he reversed course, and from 1901, soon after his return from Europe, until
  his death in 1910, Twain was vice-president of the American Anti-Imperialist League,[79] which opposed the annexation
  of the Philippines by the United States and had "tens of thousands of members."[30] He wrote many political pamphlets
  for the organization. The Incident in the Philippines, posthumously published in 1924, was in response to the Moro
  Crater Massacre, in which six hundred Moros were killed. Many of his neglected and previously uncollected writings on
  anti-imperialism appeared for the first time in book form in 1992.[79]
</p>

<p>
  Twain was critical of imperialism in other countries as well. In Following the Equator, Twain expresses "hatred and
  condemnation of imperialism of all stripes."[30] He was highly critical of European imperialism, notably of Cecil
  Rhodes, who greatly expanded the British Empire, and of Leopold II, King of the Belgians.[30] King Leopold's Soliloquy
  is a stinging political satire about his private colony, the Congo Free State. Reports of outrageous exploitation and
  grotesque abuses led to widespread international protest in the early 1900s, arguably the first large-scale human
  rights movement. In the soliloquy, the King argues that bringing Christianity to the country outweighs a little
  starvation. Leopold's rubber gatherers were tortured, maimed and slaughtered, until the movement forced Brussels to
  call a halt.[80][81]
</p>

<p>
  During the Philippine-American War, Twain wrote a short pacifist story entitled The War Prayer, which makes the point
  that humanism and Christianity's preaching of love are incompatible with the conduct of war. It was submitted to
  Harper's Bazaar for publication, but on March 22, 1905, the magazine rejected the story as "not quite suited to a
  woman's magazine." Eight days later, Twain wrote to his friend Daniel Carter Beard, to whom he had read the story, "I
  don't think the prayer will be published in my time. None but the dead are permitted to tell the truth." Because he
  had an exclusive contract with Harper & Brothers, Twain could not publish The War Prayer elsewhere; it remained
  unpublished until 1923. It was republished as campaigning material by Vietnam War protesters.[30]
</p>

<p>
  Twain acknowledged he originally sympathized with the more moderate Girondins of the French Revolution and then
  shifted his sympathies to the more radical Sansculottes, indeed identifying as "a Marat." Twain supported the
  revolutionaries in Russia against the reformists, arguing that the Tsar must be got rid of, by violent means, because
  peaceful ones would not work.[82] He summed up his views of revolutions in the following statement:
</p>
<blockquote>
  I am said to be a revolutionist in my sympathies, by birth, by breeding and by principle. I am always on the side of
  the revolutionists, because there never was a revolution unless there were some oppressive and intolerable conditions
  against which to revolute.[83]
</blockquote>
<h3>Civil rights</h3>

<p>
  Twain was an adamant supporter of the abolition of slavery and emancipation of slaves, even going so far to say
  "Lincoln's Proclamation ... not only set the black slaves free, but set the white man free also."[84] He argued that
  non-whites did not receive justice in the United States, once saying "I have seen Chinamen abused and maltreated in
  all the mean, cowardly ways possible to the invention of a degraded nature ... but I never saw a Chinaman righted in a
  court of justice for wrongs thus done to him."[85] He paid for at least one black person to attend Yale Law School and
  for another black person to attend a southern university to become a minister.[86]
</p>

<p>
  Twain's views on race were not reflected in his early sketches of Native Americans. Of them, Twain wrote in 1870:
</p>
<blockquote>
  His heart is a cesspool of falsehood, of treachery, and of low and devilish instincts. With him, gratitude is an
  unknown emotion; and when one does him a kindness, it is safest to keep the face toward him, lest the reward be an
  arrow in the back. To accept of a favor from him is to assume a debt which you can never repay to his satisfaction,
  though you bankrupt yourself trying. The scum of the earth![87]
</blockquote>
<p>
  As counterpoint, Twain's essay on "The Literary Offenses of Fenimore Cooper" offers a much kinder view of Indians.[67]
  "No, other Indians would have noticed these things, but Cooper's Indians never notice anything. Cooper thinks they are
  marvelous creatures for noticing, but he was almost always in error about his Indians. There was seldom a sane one
  among them."[88] In his later travelogue Following the Equator (1897), Twain observes that in colonized lands all over
  the world, "savages" have always been wronged by "whites" in the most merciless ways, such as "robbery, humiliation,
  and slow, slow murder, through poverty and the white man's whiskey"; his conclusion is that "there are many humorous
  things in this world; among them the white man's notion that he is less savage than the other savages.".[89] In an
  expression that captures his Indian experiences, he wrote, “So far as I am able to judge nothing has been left undone,
  either by man or Nature, to make India the most extraordinary country that the sun visits on his rounds. Where every
  prospect pleases, and only man is vile.”[90]
</p>

<p>
  Twain was also a staunch supporter of women's rights and an active campaigner for women's suffrage. His "Votes for
  Women" speech, in which he pressed for the granting of voting rights to women, is considered one of the most famous in
  history.[91]
</p>

<p>
  Helen Keller benefited from Twain's support, as she pursued her college education and publishing, despite her
  disabilities and financial limitations.
</p>

<h3>Labor</h3>

<p>
  Twain wrote glowingly about unions in the river boating industry in Life on the Mississippi, which was read in union
  halls decades later.[92] He supported the labor movement, especially one of the most important unions, the Knights of
  Labor.[30] In a speech to them, he said:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Who are the oppressors? The few: the King, the capitalist, and a handful of other overseers and superintendents. Who
  are the oppressed? The many: the nations of the earth; the valuable personages; the workers; they that make the bread
  that the soft-handed and idle eat.[93]
</blockquote>
<h3>Vivisection</h3>

<p>
  Twain was opposed to the vivisection practices of his day. His objection was not on a scientific basis but rather an
  ethical one. He specifically cited the pain caused to the animal as his basis of his opposition.[94]
</p>

<p>
  I am not interested to know whether vivisection produces results that are profitable to the human race or doesn't. ...
  The pain which it inflicts upon unconsenting animals is the basis of my enmity toward it, and it is to me sufficient
  justification of the enmity without looking further.
</p>

<h3>Religion</h3>

<p>
  Although Twain was a Presbyterian, he was sometimes critical of organized religion and certain elements of
  Christianity through his later life. He wrote, for example, "Faith is believing what you know ain't so," and "If
  Christ were here now there is one thing he would not be—a Christian."[95] Nonetheless, as a mature adult he engaged in
  religious discussions and attended services, his theology developing as he wrestled with the deaths of loved ones and
  his own mortality.[96] His own experiences and suffering within his family made him particularly critical of "faith
  healing," such as espoused by Mary Baker Eddy and Christian Science.[citation needed]
</p>

<p>
  Twain generally avoided publishing his most heretical opinions on religion in his lifetime, and they are known from
  essays and stories that were published later. In the essay Three Statements of the Eighties in the 1880s, Twain stated
  that he believed in an almighty God, but not in any messages, revelations, holy scriptures such as the Bible,
  Providence, or retribution in the afterlife. He did state that "the goodness, the justice, and the mercy of God are
  manifested in His works," but also that "the universe is governed by strict and immutable laws," which determine
  "small matters," such as who dies in a pestilence.[97] At other times he wrote or spoke in ways that contradicted a
  strict deist view, for example, plainly professing a belief in Providence.[98] In some later writings in the 1890s, he
  was less optimistic about the goodness of God, observing that "if our Maker is all-powerful for good or evil, He is
  not in His right mind." At other times, he conjectured sardonically that perhaps God had created the world with all
  its tortures for some purpose of His own, but was otherwise indifferent to humanity, which was too petty and
  insignificant to deserve His attention anyway.[99]
</p>

<p>
  In 1901 Twain criticized the actions of missionary Dr. William Scott Ament (1851–1909) because Ament and other
  missionaries had collected indemnities from Chinese subjects in the aftermath of the Boxer Uprising of 1900. Twain's
  response to hearing of Ament's methods was published in the North American Review in February 1901: To the Person
  Sitting in Darkness, and deals with examples of imperialism in China, South Africa, and with the U.S. occupation of
  the Philippines.[100] A subsequent article, "To My Missionary Critics" published in The North American Review in April
  1901, unapologetically continues his attack, but with the focus shifted from Ament to his missionary superiors, the
  American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.[101]
</p>

<p>
  After his death, Twain's family suppressed some of his work that was especially irreverent toward conventional
  religion, notably Letters from the Earth, which was not published until his daughter Clara reversed her position in
  1962 in response to Soviet propaganda about the withholding.[102] The anti-religious The Mysterious Stranger was
  published in 1916. Little Bessie, a story ridiculing Christianity, was first published in the 1972 collection Mark
  Twain's Fables of Man.[103]
</p>

<p>
  Despite these views, he raised money to build a Presbyterian Church in Nevada in 1864, although it has been argued
  that it was only by his association with his Presbyterian brother that he did that.[104]
</p>

<p>
  Twain created a reverent portrayal of Joan of Arc, a subject over which he had obsessed for forty years, studied for a
  dozen years and spent two years writing.[105] In 1900 and again in 1908, he stated, "I like Joan of Arc best of all my
  books, it is the best." [105][106]
</p>

<p>
  Those who knew Twain well late in life recount that he dwelt on the subject of the afterlife, his daughter Clara
  saying: "Sometimes he believed death ended everything, but most of the time he felt sure of a life beyond."[107]
</p>

<p>
  Twain's frankest views on religion appeared in his final work Autobiography of Mark Twain, the publication of which
  started in November 2010, 100 years after his death. In it, he said:[108]
</p>
<blockquote>
  There is one notable thing about our Christianity: bad, bloody, merciless, money-grabbing, and predatory as it is—in
  our country particularly and in all other Christian countries in a somewhat modified degree—it is still a hundred
  times better than the Christianity of the Bible, with its prodigious crime—the invention of Hell. Measured by our
  Christianity of to-day, bad as it is, hypocritical as it is, empty and hollow as it is, neither the Deity nor his Son
  is a Christian, nor qualified for that moderately high place. Ours is a terrible religion. The fleets of the world
  could swim in spacious comfort in the innocent blood it has spilled.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Twain was a Freemason.[109][110] He belonged to Polar Star Lodge No. 79 A.F.&A.M., based in St. Louis. He was
  initiated an Entered Apprentice on May 22, 1861, passed to the degree of Fellow Craft on June 12, and raised to the
  degree of Master Mason on July 10.
</p>

<h2>Pen names</h2>

<p>
  Twain used different pen names before deciding on "'Mark Twain". He signed humorous and imaginative sketches as "Josh"
  until 1863. Additionally, he used the pen name "Thomas Jefferson Snodgrass" for a series of humorous letters.[111]
</p>

<p>
  He maintained that his primary pen name came from his years working on Mississippi riverboats, where two fathoms, a
  depth indicating safe water for passage of boat, was measured on the sounding line. Twain is an archaic term for
  "two", as in "The veil of the temple was rent in twain." [112] The riverboatman's cry was "mark twain" or, more fully,
  "by the mark twain", meaning "according to the mark [on the line], [the depth is] two [fathoms]," that is, "The water
  is 12 feet (3.7 m) deep and it is safe to pass."
</p>

<p>
  Twain claimed that his famous pen name was not entirely his invention. In Life on the Mississippi, he wrote:
</p>
<blockquote>
  Captain Isaiah Sellers was not of literary turn or capacity, but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of plain
  practical information about the river, and sign them "MARK TWAIN," and give them to the New Orleans Picayune. They
  related to the stage and condition of the river, and were accurate and valuable; ... At the time that the telegraph
  brought the news of his death, I was on the Pacific coast. I was a fresh new journalist, and needed a nom de guerre;
  so I confiscated the ancient mariner's discarded one, and have done my best to make it remain what it was in his hands
  – a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth;
  how I have succeeded, it would not be modest in me to say.[113]
</blockquote>
<p>
  Twain's story about his pen name has been questioned by biographer George Williams III,[114] the Territorial
  Enterprise newspaper,[115] and Purdue University's Paul Fatout.[116] The claim is that "mark twain" refers to a
  running bar tab that Twain would regularly incur while drinking at John Piper's saloon in Virginia City, Nevada.
</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>

<p>
  Twain's legacy lives on today as his namesakes continue to multiply. Several schools are named after him, including
  Mark Twain Elementary School in Wheeling, Illinois, and Mark Twain Elementary School in Houston, Texas, which has a
  statue of Twain sitting on a bench. There is also Mark Twain Intermediate School in New York. There are several
  schools named Mark Twain Middle School in different states, as well as Samuel Clemens High School in Schertz, near San
  Antonio, Texas. There are also other structures, such as the Mark Twain Memorial Bridge.
</p>

<p>
  Mark Twain Village is a United States Army installation located in the Südstadt district of Heidelberg, Germany. It is
  one of two American bases in the United States Army Garrison Heidelberg that house American soldiers and their
  families (the other being Patrick Henry Village).
</p>

<p>
  Awards in his name proliferate. In 1998, The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts created the Mark Twain
  Prize for American Humor, awarded annually. The Mark Twain Award is an award given annually to a book for children in
  grades four through eight by the Missouri Association of School Librarians. Stetson University in DeLand, Florida
  sponsors the Mark Twain Young Authors' Workshop each summer in collaboration with the Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum
  in Hannibal. The program is open to young authors in grades five through eight.[117] The museum sponsors the Mark
  Twain Creative Teaching Award.[118]
</p>

<p>
  Buildings associated with Twain, including some of his many homes, have been preserved as museums. His birthplace is
  preserved in Florida, Missouri. The Mark Twain Boyhood Home & Museum in Hannibal, Missouri preserves the setting for
  some of the author's best known work. The home of childhood friend Laura Hawkins, said to be the inspiration for his
  fictional character Becky Thatcher, is preserved as the "Thatcher House." In May 2007, a painstaking reconstruction of
  the home of Tom Blankenship, the inspiration for Huckleberry Finn, was opened to the public. The family home he had
  built in Hartford, Connecticut, where he and his wife raised their three daughters, is preserved and open to visitors
  as the Mark Twain House.
</p>

<p>
  On December 4, 1985, the United States Postal Service issued a stamped envelope for "Mark Twain and Halley's Comet,"
  noting the connection with Twain's birth, his death, and the comet.[119] On June 25, 2011, the Postal Service released
  a Forever stamp in his honor.[120]
</p>

<h2>Depictions</h2>

<p>
  Twain is often depicted wearing a white suit. While there is evidence that suggests that, after Livy's death in 1904,
  Twain began wearing white suits on the lecture circuit, modern representations suggesting that he wore them throughout
  his life are unfounded. However, there is evidence showing him wearing a white suit before 1904. In 1882, he sent a
  photograph of himself in a white suit to 18-year-old Edward W. Bok, later publisher of the Ladies Home Journal, with a
  handwritten dated note on verso. It did eventually become his trademark, as illustrated in anecdotes about this
  eccentricity (such as the time he wore a white summer suit to a Congressional hearing during the winter).[38]
  McMasters' The Mark Twain Encyclopedia states that Twain did not wear a white suit in his last three years, except at
  one banquet speech.[121]
</p>

<p>
  Actor Hal Holbrook created a one-man show called Mark Twain Tonight, which he has performed regularly for about 59
  years.[122] The broadcast by CBS in 1967 won him an Emmy Award. Of the three runs on Broadway (1966, 1977, and 2005),
  the first won him a Tony Award.
</p>

<p>
  Twain was portrayed by Fredric March in the 1944 film The Adventures of Mark Twain. He was later brought to life by
  James Whitmore in the (similarly titled) 1985 Will Vinton Claymation film The Adventures of Mark Twain. In the
  two-part Star Trek: The Next Generation episode, "Time's Arrow Pt. 1 & 2", the crew of the starship Enterprise pursues
  malevolent alien lifeforms through a time portal to 1893 San Francisco, where their secretive actions arouse the
  suspicions of Samuel Clemens as played by Jerry Hardin.</p>
